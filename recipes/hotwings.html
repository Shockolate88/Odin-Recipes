    <h2>Prep the Chicken</h2>
    <ol>

        <br>
        <li>discard the excess brine and pat your chicken wings dry. Season generously with Â¾ cup of my Hot Seasoning. Set chicken aside until ready to use. In the meantime we move onto the sauce.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Put all the White Sauce ingredients to a small bowl and mix. Set in the fridge until ready to use.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat your appliance, in this case i will use a smoker, preheat to 250f. Add your chicken wings to the smoker and cook for about 1.5-2 hours. Once done let them rest for 2-3 minutes.</li>
